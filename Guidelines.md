# General guidelines for contributors
- In order to keep the pace of development, try to push as frequently.
- If you have scripts that may be useful but does not fit in any of the top level directories, put in user specific
  directory.
- Put all the documents in this repository only to keep consistency. Google group is mostly for discussion. Sometimes
  you may want to share files which is for intermediate purposes. In that case create a gist, or put in your
user-specific directory and provide a link. Once the file has served its purpose you can delete if necessary. git keeps
everything in history so nothing will be lost forever.
- Ask questions frequently. A general rule is, if you are stuck for more than an hour then ask!
